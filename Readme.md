(Train Data) 

So that, the marketing team could get glimpse of margin, worthiness of investment for each projects based on predicted data to ranking priority of prospective areas.

# Conclusion

After deploying 4 models, 

Model#4 is surely perform best but might be unrealistic in term of generalization trading off with preciseness improvement from Model#3 â€” (i.e. 19 features vs 14 features)

Whlist Model#3 has drastically different score from Model#2 given that they have equal no. of features which proof that Province and Subdistrict are better representative of location features than Latitude and Longitude or the latter 2 are needed engineering before fitting with the model.

For further studies, We could dive deep onto Latitude & Longitude feature engineering for better prediction

Real Estate Developers may focus on floor area (usable area) > land area and try not to squeeze in too much total units as it will be effect the price. In Addition, customer convenience for living (facility, transportation and shop nearby) also plays key roles in  marking up price for real estate project.
